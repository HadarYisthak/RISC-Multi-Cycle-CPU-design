# RISC-Multi-Cycle-CPU-design
This project showcases a multi-cycle CPU design in VHDL, emphasizing clear separation between control and datapath. It features a Mealy FSM-based control unit, a modular datapath, and key components like an ALU and instruction register to efficiently execute a predefined instruction set.
